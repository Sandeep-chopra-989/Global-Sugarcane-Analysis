## 🎯 Objective

To perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sugarcane production data to:
- Identify top sugarcane-producing countries.
- Analyze year-wise trends in production.
- Visualize geographical and temporal patterns.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – Analysis environment

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Import and inspect dataset
2. Clean missing or inconsistent data
3. Aggregate production by country and year
4. Generate visualizations:
   - Top 10 producing countries
   - Year-over-year production trends
   - Country-wise comparisons using bar and line plots
5. Draw conclusions and highlight key insights

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- 📈 **Line Plot**: Global sugarcane production over years  
- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Top 10 sugarcane producers  
- 🌐 **Heatmap**: Correlation of production with year  
- 📍 **Country-wise Trend Analysis**

---

## ✅ Results

- **Brazil** consistently ranked as the top sugarcane producer.
- **India** and **China** also among leading contributors.
- Some countries showed fluctuations due to weather, policy, or land use changes.
- Year-wise analysis revealed global production growth with occasional dips.
